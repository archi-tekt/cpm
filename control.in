Description: This program is a ncurses based console tool to manage passwords
 and store them public key encrypted in a file - even for more than one person.
 The encryption is handled via GnuPG so the programs data can be accessed via
 gpg as well, in case you want to have a look inside.
 The data is stored as as zlib compressed XML so it's even possible to reuse
 the data for some other purpose.
 This package is currently in beta stage.
